*******************
Additional features
*******************

The previous chapter describes the use of core functionality contained within ``lib_xua``.
This section details enabling additional features with supported external dependencies, for example,
``lib_xua`` can provide S/PDIF output through the use of `lib_spdif <www.xmos.com/file/lib_spdif>`_.

Where something must be defined, it is recommended this is done in `xua_conf.h` but could also be
done in the application `CMakeLists.txt`.
